#Project Built for HackMit 2023

J.A.C.K. AI uses a trained computer vision model to analyze and monitor a patient's physical therapy exercises. The model is trained on correct and incorrect forms of exercises and identifies not just if a patient is doing an exercise incorrectly, but how they are doing an exercise incorrectly. We then provide users with personalized AI-generated feedback with GPT-4.
